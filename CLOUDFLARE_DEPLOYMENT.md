# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

This Next.js project has been configured for static export to be compatible with Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
};
```

### 2. Build Scripts (`package.json`)
- `build`: Standard Next.js build with static export
- `build-static`: Alias for the build command
- `export`: Informational script about modern approach

## Cloudflare Pages Settings

### Build Configuration
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Build output directory**: `out`

## Static Export Features

## Deployment Process
1. Connect your repository to Cloudflare Pages
